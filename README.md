# GettingAndCleaningData - Project
This file does a couple of things
* It explains the HOW of things - from the "Getting And Cleaning Data" project perspective.
* Throws a brief light on all the files included in this repository namely:
     * run_analysis.md

# The Assignment:
The Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 was created based on an experiment that was carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (referred to as "Subjects" in the dataset) who performed six activities (Walking, Walking_upstairs, Walking-downstairs,Sitting, Standing, Laying).  Information about this dataset can be found in the HAR-Readme.txt in this repository.  

The dataset itself can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The assignment demands that we do the following:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
